# Machine learning Portfolio :

This a collection of fully operational Data Science / Machine Learning projects completed by me for academic, self learning (Udacity, Coursera, CS50, Kaggle, InsideSherpa, LinkedIn Learning), and hobby purposes.

Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

(WORK IN PROGRESS ...)
